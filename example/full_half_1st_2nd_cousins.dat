# generates one simulated pedigree with four generations
# in generation 2, there are two full siblings, one in each branch
# these two full siblings each have a pair of offspring that form four branches
# in generation 3.
# in generation 4, the four branches each produce one child and these children
# get printed.
# Thus, since there are four branches in generation three, two sets of which are
# full siblings of each other, the final generation has two pairs of first
# cousins with all other pairwise relationships being second cousins.

# and half-second cousins in the fourth generation.
